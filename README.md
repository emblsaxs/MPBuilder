# MPBuilder
MPBuilder provides building capability for protein-detergent, bicelle, and lipid-scaffold (saposin nanoparticles, nanodiscs) complexes and links this to the ATSAS software package modules for model refinement and validation against the SAXS data.
Below is the example GUI snapshot for detergent complexes.
